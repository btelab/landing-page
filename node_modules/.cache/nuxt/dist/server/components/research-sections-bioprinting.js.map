The BTELab focuses on controlling the printed constructs'\\n        architecture, morphology, and biological properties to generate 3D platforms that reproduce their\\n        human equivalents fairly. Our latest works show an improvement in this technology for different\\n        aspects, such as greater functionality of the printed tissues through better vascularization and\\n        exploring the synergy with other additive manufacturing techniques. Our team's multidisciplinarity\\n        enables the control of the process from the early stage of machine design to cell preparation, which\\n        allows us to adapt the 3D printers to the specific needs of different projects and research\\n        lines.<br>The main applications of our bioprinted constructs in the lab are the following:</p> <ul class=\\\"list-inside list-disc text-xl align-center\\\"><li>Study of tissue and organ regeneration</li> <li>Explore mechanisms of diseases</li> <li>Drug sensitivity tests</li> <li>Drug development</li></ul> <p class=\\\"text-xl\\\">We are developing broad collaborations with various stakeholders to investigate other\\n        potential avenues of investigation and treatment.</p> <h3 class=\\\"font-serif text-2xl mb-4 mt-10\\\">3D PRINTING IN CLINICS</h3> <p class=\\\"text-xl\\\">We are interested in applying 3D printing techniques in clinical contexts to create\\n        realistic and anatomically precise 3D printed models generated from medical images for surgery\\n        planning, training, and teaching applications. Together with other medical departments and hospital\\n        services, we have started a pioneer work to provide them with these complex and personalized 3D\\n        realistic models that can potentially be used in their surgeries or teaching activities. BTELab\\n        facilities include the most advanced technologies to create the models in different polymers and\\n        resins, controlling not only colors and textures but also stiffness and elongation. Our expertise in\\n        medical image processing and digital model manipulation is essential to be capable of extracting the\\n        whole complexity and anatomical structure of the human organs and tissues from the medical images.\\n    </p>\")])}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n//\n\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n    name: \"Bioprinting\"\r\n}\r\n","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js??ref--2-0!../../node_modules/@nuxt/components/dist/loader.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./bioprinting.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js??ref--2-0!../../node_modules/@nuxt/components/dist/loader.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./bioprinting.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./bioprinting.vue?vue&type=template&id=da85e922&\"\nimport script from \"./bioprinting.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./bioprinting.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  \"11f146f8\"\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;;;;;ACFA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAGA;AACA;AADA;;ACtCA;;;;;ACAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
