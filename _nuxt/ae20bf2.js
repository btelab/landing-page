Creating models and substitutes using\n                    engineering approaches and xeno-free cell derivatives, designing directed differentiation\n                    protocols.\n                    Our efforts are also looking to identify the factors central to mediated regulation of\n                    angiogenesis,\n                    fibrosis, immune modulation, and epigenetics. We have a library of hASCs from over 200 different\n                    donors fully characterized and tested against pathogens, adventitious viruses, or zoonotic\n                    agents.\n                ")])])}],!1,null,null,null);e.default=component.exports}}]);
